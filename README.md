# vimod-pub-combo
Generate Vimod-Pub pub.cmd and Vimod-Pub-Solo pub.cmd from mostly the same source functions. Try and create a common pub.cmd.

## History

This project is taking over the development of the core vimod-pub pub.cmd batch file. It was getting impossible to develope the original pub.cmd for a classic setup and also for the solo and global versions as well as a combo version of all three. Hence this new project that is mor modular. 

At this time only the classic and solo versions will be developed.

## Usage

This project has no independent usage. It is (or will be used) to create updated versions of the pub.cmd for classic, solo and global projects.
